# KinectJigsawPuzzle
This application is based on Kinect for Windows and developed in WPF. 
Here, I have created a Jigsaw Puzzle which can be played using motion sensing.
Three levels have been introduced: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.
Few images I have used for the application which can be replaced.
