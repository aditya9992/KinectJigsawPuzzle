# KinectJigsawPuzzle
This project is developed on Kinect for Windows V1 and as a WPF application for Desktop.
I borrowed some of the code for Puzzle from  CodeProject, and implemented Kinect sensor to create the application.
This is a basic 3 level Kinect Jigsa Puzzle Game where a person can play.
Here, the levels are as follows: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.
Have fun downloading it and adding tweaks to the application.
Hope, you will find it useful!
